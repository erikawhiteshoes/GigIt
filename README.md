# GigIt

A web application to track and manage professional music gigs. As a freelancer, there is a lot of data that I need to track for tax purposes.  Accounting software often has too many features which I would not use, but is still too limited for a musician's purposes.  

•	Node.js and Express backend.

•	Key-Value Database layer using NeDB, based on Mongo
